              Hi! I am Ron Marquez and I am born and raise in San Diego. I
              graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering
              from University of California, San Diego in 2011. I have been
              working for a software company for the last 13-14 years as a Test
              Engineer. I have been taking courses at San Diego Community
              College throughout the years to keep learning new things.
              <br /><br />Aside from my educational background, I have 1 dog who
              is 4 years old and keeps me busy. He is quite the character.

            <h2 class="text-center">Reason for taking class</h2>
            <p class="lead mt-5">
              I am taking this course to familiarize myself with developing web
              pages. I do not have alot of experience writing code, so these
              course at Miramar college help me achieve this goal. I am
              interested in completing all teh required courses to achieve Web
              Design Associates of Science degree!
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-center">What I hope I gain?</h3>
            <p class="lead mt-5">
              I hope to gain more skills building websites from the ground up. I
              have taken the course prior to this about a year ago, so I am
              hoping knock off the rust and build on that course. When I take
              these courses, it inspires me when I see instructors or other
              students create pages quickly and effectively. I would like to
              gain more experience with website layouts and responsive design.

            <p class="lead mt-5">
              I currently work for a company which builds software for the Navy.
              I run the testing group for multiple projects, so I am familiar
              with software, but now writing code. I have also taken the
              following courses:

            <p>
              On my free time, I enjoy being outside doing activities away from
              the computer and away from my phone. You can find me running on
              the weekends, lifting or working out on the week days, or even
              cooking. Most of all, you can find me walking my dog everyday!
