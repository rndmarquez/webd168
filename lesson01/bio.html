                    <p>Hi! I am Ron Marquez and I am born and raise in San Diego.  I graduated with a 
                        Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering from University of California, San Diego in 2011. 
                        I have been working for a software company for the last 13-14 years as a Test Engineer. I have been taking courses
                        at San Diego Community College throughout the years to keep learning new things.
                        <br>
                        <br>Aside from my educational background, I have 1 dog who is 4 years old and keeps me busy. He is quite the character.

                    <!--Reason for taking course-->
                    <h2>Reason for taking class</h2>
                    <p>I am taking this course to familiarize myself with developing web pages.
                        I do not have alot of experience writing code, so these course at Miramar college
                        help me achieve this goal.  I am interested in completing all teh required courses to achieve Web Design 
                        Associates of Science degree!

                    <h3>What I Hope To Gain?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I hope to gain more skills building websites from the ground up.  
                        I have taken the course prior to this about a year ago, so I am hoping knock off the rust and build on that course.  When I take these courses,
                        it inspires me when I see instructors or other students create pages quickly and effectively.  I
                        would like to gain more experience with website layouts and responsive design.
